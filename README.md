# philosophers

**A multithreading project based on the classical "Dining Philosophers Problem", focusing on thread synchronization, resource sharing, and deadlock prevention.**

## Objectives
- Solve the "Dining Philosophers Problem" using multithreading and synchronization primitives (mutexes).
- Manage concurrent access to shared resources (forks) safely and efficiently.
- Prevent deadlocks, starvation, and race conditions through careful thread design.
- Handle timing constraints precisely, ensuring philosophers' actions (eating, sleeping, thinking) are correctly managed.

## Skills developed
- Deep understanding of thread creation, management, and synchronization using mutexes.
- Designing algorithms to prevent classic concurrency issues (deadlocks, starvation).
- Fine-grained control of timing and resource sharing between concurrent entities.
- Writing clean, thread-safe, and efficient C code under strict system constraints.
